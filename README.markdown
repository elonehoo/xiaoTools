## Getting Started

### Dependency management tools

Below is a brief guide to using dependency management tools like Maven or Gradle.

#### Maven

To use maven add this dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.xiao-organization</groupId>
  <artifactId>xiaoTools</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle

To use Gradle add the Maven central repository to your repositories list:

```xml
mavenCentral()
```

Then you can just add the latest version to your build.

```xml
implementation 'io.github.xiao-organization:xiaoTools:1.0.1'
```

Standalone jar
If you do not use any dependency management tool, you can find the latest standalone jar [here](https://github.com/xiao-organization/xiaoTools/releases/latest).
